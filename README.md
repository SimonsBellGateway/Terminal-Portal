Making some stuff for fun!

This is a persional project in which I am focusing on the mechanics of a text-based game rather than on the gameplay.

Objectives
1. Learning to make a project, with some fun.
2. Make a library for text-based games and for non-text-based games(NPC talks for example).

Plan:
For now the plan is to make events and have a way to make events(I have a very big vocabulary XD) soo that if someone uses it, he can keep his sanity.

Changes:
Made some progress on the console interface
